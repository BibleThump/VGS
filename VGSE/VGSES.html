			<h1>Mobius strip</h1>
			<p> Mobius strip is a surface with only one side and only one boundary. The Mobius strip has the mathematical property of being non-orientable. It can be realized as a ruled surface. It was discovered independently by the German mathematicians August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius and Johann Benedict Listing in 1858.</p>

			<h1>Borromean rings</h1>
			<p>In mathematics, the Borromean rings consist of three topological circles which are linked and form a Brunnian link (i.e., removing any ring results in two unlinked rings). In other words, no two of the three rings are linked with each other as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_link">hopf link </a>, but nonetheless all three are linked.</p>
